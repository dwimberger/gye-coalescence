= Introduction =

gye-coalescence is a framework for the simulation of sequence evolution and the analysis of generated sample configurations. It's written in 100% Java (5, uses generics) and should run on any platform a Java 5 JRE is available for.

At the moment the main objective is the simulation of the evolution of microsatellite sequences and the analysis of the generated sample configurations. In particular we target uniparental cSSRp sequences (basic coalescent) and try to obtain analysis that help to investigate the effects of homoplasy on population genetics parameters.
